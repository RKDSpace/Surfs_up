# Surfs_up

# Overview of the Analysis:

W. Avy likes the analysis but wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. The purpose of this analysis is to gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine fi the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The results be provided, and recommendations will be provided to W. Avy. 

# Results

The summary statistics provide a lot of the analysis that is interesting for anyone as well as w Avy to see. Rather than going throught the list which is very detailed the summary statistics provide a high-level overview of the month. One of the interesting results to see is that the minimum temperatures in both July and December are both in the colder weather temps. The list view would help us see just how often those cold days happen. Our standard deviation in the metrics also shows how off our data is, and they are both in the 3 range which is a very close margin.

Another interesting data point is looking at the maximum temperatures. The maximum temperatures are both in the mid-80s. 85 and 83 respectively for July and December. Since December is a winter month it would be expected that the temperatures would be colder, but they are only lower by 2 degrees. This data is very valuable to decide to open a surf and shave shop. The graphic below shows the summary stats for both months:

The results I would go over is based on the number of days. June has 30 days and December has 31 days, but the counts are still only off by 200 which is a good margin to represent that we have accurate as possible information from our dataset.
